But before you start envisioning a future of thuggery, pause a moment. Hitting among preschoolers is not a reflection of bad parenting or genetics. It’s quite common behavior.</p><h4 class="p2"><strong>There Is Always a Reason:</strong></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s2">Put simply, hitting arises from frustration, lack of impulse control, and a toddlers’ limited ability to express their needs in words.</span></p><p class="p3"><strong>• Toddlers are still learning self-control: </strong>They get frustrated, overwhelmed, or really mad, and they often lack the ability to pause and think before reacting (remind you of road rage?).</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They rely on actions, not words: </strong>If sharing isn’t going their way or another child is too close, their instinct might be to push or hit.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Impulse control develops over time: </strong>Typically, later than we wish! Expecting a preschooler to manage frustration without physical reactions is like expecting a puppy to stop chewing shoes just because you asked politely.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They’re testing boundaries: </strong>A reaction means they’re learning about limits, emotions, and what happens when impulses take over.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They’re saying hello: </strong>Surprisingly, some children hit simply to get attention—from both adults and other children. It’s their way of saying, “I’m here!”</p><h4 class="p2"><strong>Here's What I've Found Works:</strong></h4><p class="p3"><strong>• Stay calm: </strong>If your child is lashing out, the last thing they need is for you to escalate the situation with your frustration. They need guidance, not intensity.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Look for triggers: Ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li class="p5">Where does the behavior happen?</li><li class="p5">What happened right before?</li><li class="p5">Is the environment overstimulating or chaotic?</li><li class="p5">Are there patterns with specific people or settings?</li></ul><p class="p6">Finding patterns helps you understand (and prevent) future outbursts.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Model positive responses: </strong>Instead of forcing an insincere “sorry,” try narrating the situation: “You really wanted that truck, but hitting hurts. Let’s check if they’re okay.” Teaching empathy through actions works better than insisting on empty words.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Help them find the words: </strong><span class="s2">Encourage alternatives: “When you’re mad, say ‘I’m mad!’ instead of hitting.” They won’t always remember, but the more you reinforce it, the sooner it will click.</span></p><p class="p3"><strong>• Be consistent: </strong>If hitting happens, remove them from the situation and explain: “I can’t let you hurt others. You can take a break until you’re ready to be gentle.” This isn’t punishment, but a moment to reset.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Teach physical alternatives: </strong>Some children genuinely need physical outlets. Offer stress balls, tight hugs, or stomping as ways to release frustration without hurting others. Outdoor play (or maybe a punching bag?) is also great for calming some children down.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Ensure adequate sleep and nutrition: </strong>Overtired or hungry children have much lower frustration tolerance and impulse control. Sticking to consistent sleep schedules and offering regular, healthy meals/snacks can significantly reduce hitting triggered by physical discomfort.</p><h4 class="p2"><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></h4><p class="p3"><strong>• They hit again moments later: </strong>Learning self-control takes time. Keep reinforcing boundaries and don’t expect instant results.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They don’t seem to care that they hurt someone: </strong>Empathy is learned through experience. Keep modeling it—eventually, it will sink in.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They hit when they’re excited, not just angry: </strong>Some children hit when overstimulated. Help them find calmer ways to engage or take a break.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• They laugh when you correct them: </strong>This isn’t defiance—it’s often nervousness or discomfort. Keep your tone steady and clear, and don’t take the giggles personally.</p><p class="p3"><strong>• Hitting is directed primarily at one person: </strong>If the hitting seems targeted rather than random frustration, look for triggers. <span class="s2">What happened just before the hitting? Is there a pattern of provocation (even unintentional)?</span> Once you know what the trigger is, you can address it.</p><h4 class="p2"><strong>Look on the Bright Side</strong></h4><p class="p1">Hitting is common and developmentally very typical during the toddler and preschool years. Young children don’t yet have the tools to manage big emotions or social situations, so they often express themselves through action. This doesn’t mean you should ignore it. It means you should approach it calmly, consistently, and with understanding. Hitting isn’t a sign of bad parenting or a bad child; it’s a sign that your child is still learning how to navigate their big feelings.</p><p class="p7">●●●</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on June 13, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thereisalwaysareason.com/tags/sample-chapters/">Sample Chapters</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thereisalwaysareason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thereisalwaysareason.com/authors/maria-vernon/" rel="author">Maria Vernon</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thereisalwaysareason.com/post-2.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thereisalwaysareason.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Anger-300-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="799" width="799"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Anger</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center">Copyright © 2025 Maria Vernon.
